# docker-azcli

Docker Images with Azure AzCLI

Two simple Images for `az` commands.

Both should work fine, but the Ubuntu image is there for those of you who like big packages. ( ͡☉ ͜ʖ ͡☉)

## Run examples

```docker
docker run gazataeon/azcli:ubuntu-18.04
```

or

```docker
docker run gazataeon/azcli:alpine-3.10.2
```
